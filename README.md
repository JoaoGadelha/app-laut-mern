Simple CRUD application with PERN stack

Application developed with the PERN stack (postgresql, express.js, react.js and node.js) for learning and testing purposes. Connecting Node.js to a SQL table is, at the moment, something new for me. Also, the application backend implementation needs to be improved, the passwords are not hashed and the backend doesn't use tokens to authenticate the user.  The SQL database and Node.js/Express.js backend are hosted by Heroku, while the website is hosted in Netlify.

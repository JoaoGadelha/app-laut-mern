Simple CRUD application with PERN stack

Application developed with the PERN stack (postgresql, express.js, react.js and node.js) for learning and testing purposes. Connect Node.js to a SQL table is, at the moment, something new for me. The SQL database and Node.js/Express.js backend are hosted by Heroku, while the website is hosted in Netlify.

Simple CRUD application using PERN stack

Application developed with the PERN stack (postgresql, express.js, react.js and node.js) for learning and testing purposes. The app features login and signup pages as well as a route to display the user data, such as name and e-mail. The app connects a postgreSQL database to a node.js backend application. The backend implementation needs to be improved, the passwords are not hashed and the backend doesn't use tokens to authenticate the user.  The SQL database and Node.js/Express.js backend are hosted by Heroku, while the website is hosted in Netlify.
